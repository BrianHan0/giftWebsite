        Hi Bao Bei,
        <br /><br />
        Merry Chirstmas! Ho Ho Ho! I can't believe it's our third Christmas as a couple! 
        I wish I could give you a kiss under da mistletoe RIGHT NOW. HOWEVER. Since I can't,
        I decided to write you a virtaul love letter! YAYAYAYAYAYA.      
        I love you so much. I'm so proud of you for everything you've done this year.
        I know it has been hard with your eating condition, but you have been so strong through it. 
        That isn't something anyone can do. Despite having to change your lifestyle around it, you stayed positive and I can't explain how much I admire that about you.
        Now as we are about to enter this new part of our lives, well actaully only me, I can't help be scared of what's to come. However, one thing that makes me reassured and gives me the strength to take a leap is knowing that I will have you by my side. 
        I love you so much and I can't wait until Hijinx with you!
        <br /><br />
        Forever yours,
        <br />
        WAAAAAAAAAAAAAddle Dee
